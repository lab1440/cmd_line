# bash_notes
Writing scripts for the bash shell is not something that many programmers do on
a daily basis, yet the need to write bash shell scripts on an less frequent
basis is almost imperative. Because writing bash scripts does not occur on a
reqular basis, programmers often have to relook up how to perform a certain
task. This set of example shell scripts are intended to be templates on how to
execute certain tasks that can be adjusted to meet the specific needs of the
programmer.
